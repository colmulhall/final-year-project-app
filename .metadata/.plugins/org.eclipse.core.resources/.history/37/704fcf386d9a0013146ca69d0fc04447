    <string name="aras_an_uachtarain_desc">Áras an Uachtaráin had a colourful history before becoming 
        the Official Residence of the President of Ireland. Built in 1751 Situated in the 1,752 acres of 
        the Phoenix Park near Dublin, the original house was built by Park Ranger Nathaniel Clements. By 
        1782 it had been acquired for use by the Viceroys who oversaw British rule in Ireland. Clements 
        received £25,000 for the house</string>
    <string name="papal_cross_desc">The Papal Cross was erected at the edge of Fifteen Acres for the visit 
        of Pope John Paul II on 29 September 1979. Over one million people attended an open air mass in the 
        park at the time. The white cross, which dominates its surroundings, is 35 metres (115 ft) high and 
        was built with steel girders. It was installed with some difficulty: after several attempts, the cross 
        was eventually erected just a fortnight before the Pope arrived</string>
    <string name="peoples_gardens_desc">The Gardens, located close to the Parkgate Street entrance, comprise 
        an area of 9 hectares (22 acres), and were re-opened in 1864. These gardens were initially established 
        in 1840 as the Promenade Grounds. They display Victorian horticulture, including ornamental lakes, 
        children's playground, picnic area and bedding schemes. A statue is in the gardens dedicated to executed 
        Easter Rising leader Seán Heuston. There is a plaque in honour of the Irish sculptor Jerome Connor on 
        Infirmary Road, overlooking the Garden's which he frequently visited. The opening hours are 8am till dusk. 
        Closing times vary during the year.</string>
