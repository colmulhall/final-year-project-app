    <!-- Static information for Áras an Uachtaráin -->
    <string name="aras_an_uachtarain_desc_p1">Áras an Uachtaráin had a colourful history before becoming 
        the Official Residence of the President of Ireland. Built in 1751 Situated in the 1,752 acres of 
        the Phoenix Park near Dublin, the original house was built by Park Ranger Nathaniel Clements. By 
        1782 it had been acquired for use by the Viceroys who oversaw British rule in Ireland. Clements 
        received £25,000 for the house</string>
    <string name="aras_an_uachtarain_desc_p2">The house continued as the official residence of the Viceroys 
        until 1922. For much of the period of Home Rule that followed it was the residence of the Governors
         General, the Crown’s representatives during the new dispensation. In 1938 it became the Official 
         Residence of the President of Ireland and has been used for that purpose since.</string>
    <string name="aras_an_uachtarain_desc_p3">There have been many improvements and additions to the house 
        over the years, the most noteworthy being:
        \n-Establishment of formal gardens by Decimus Burton in the 1840s
		\n-Addition of the East Wing in 1849 for the state visit of Queen Victoria
		\n-Installation of Dublin mains gas supply in 1852 and electricity in 1908
		\n-Extension of the West Wing for the visit of George V in 1911</string>
	<string name="aras_an_uachtarain_desc_p4">Aras an Uachtaráin is now the official residence of the President of 
	    Ireland. The house is open to the public each Saturday and 5 200 people visit the formal rooms and view the 
	    grounds each year. In addition to official guests at the many state functions hosted by the President, more 
	    than 11,000 visit the house by invitation each year.</string>
         
	<!-- Static information for The Papal Cross -->
    <string name="papal_cross_desc_p1">The Papal Cross was erected at the edge of Fifteen Acres for the visit 
        of Pope John Paul II on 29 September 1979. Over one million people attended an open air mass in the 
        park at the time. The white cross, which dominates its surroundings, is 35 metres (115 ft) high and 
        was built with steel girders. It was installed with some difficulty: after several attempts, the cross 
        was eventually erected just a fortnight before the Pope arrived</string>
    <string name="papal_cross_desc_p2">When Pope John Paul II died in Rome on the 2nd April 2005, at the age of 
        84 years, a memorial service was held soon afterwards at this site.  On the 8th April 2005, it hosted many 
        thousands of people who gathered in tribute, leaving flowers and other tokens of remembrance of him.</string>
